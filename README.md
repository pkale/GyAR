Designing and implementing an AR application using AR Kit, with a focus on computer vision for tracking natural feature markers, 3D user interfaces, and computer graphics. App user directs smart phone camera at a workout machine invoking a virtual human body that demos how to use the gym machine, with the muscle group in use being highlighted.
